"""
Like last assignment, we are going to be working with point
patterns.  The readings focused on iteration, sequences, and
conditional execution.  We are going to use these concepts
to write functions to:

1. Read a geojson file
2. Parse a geojson file to find the largest city by population
3. Write your own code to do something interesting with the geojson
4. Compute the mean center of a point pattern
5. Compute the average distance between neighbors
6. Compute the miminum bounding rectangle (MBR) on a point pattern
7. Compute the area of a MBR
8. Compute the expected mean distance for a given point pattern
